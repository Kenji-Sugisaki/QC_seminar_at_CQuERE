Note: Following typos in the slides were fixed.

Page 2)  Title: quantu -> quantum
Page 7)  Lines 2 and 4 from the bottom: Z_q-1 -> Z_q+1
Page 14) python program: from openfermion.transfoms -> from openfermion.transforms
Page 17) Quantum circuit: P(theta = -i*g_1*t) -> P(theta = -g_1*t)
Page 20) 3) in exp(-i*g_6*Y_0*Y_1*t): Reverse transform from X basis to Y basis -> Reverse transform from Z basis to Y basis
Page 21) 5): Remove "by CNOT ladder"
